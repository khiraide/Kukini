#Space Module

##Current Version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT

##About
The Space module provides a JavaSpace implementation built on top of HazelCast.
a JavaSpace is essentially a tuple store that preserves the type of the object
written into the space.

For more information on JavaSpaces, please read the [JavaSpaces Services
Specification](http://river.apache.org/doc/specs/html/js-spec.html).

Within the Hawaii Digital Archives, Spaces are used primarily as a coordination
mechanism between all of the other modules.
