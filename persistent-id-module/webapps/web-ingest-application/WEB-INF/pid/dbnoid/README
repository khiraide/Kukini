who:       Hawaii Digital Archives
what:      unlimited sequential identifiers of form template
       A Noid minting and binding database has been created that will bind
       and mint an unbounded number of identifiers
       with the template ".ze".
       Minting order is sequential.

Version:   Noid $Revision$
Size:      unlimited
template:  .ze
       A suggested parent directory for this template is "noid_1+".  Note:
       separate minters need separate directories, and templates can suggest
       short names; e.g., the template "xz.redek" suggests the parent directory
       "noid_xz4" since identifiers are "xz" followed by 4 characters.
Policy:    (:---I-E)
       This minter's durability summary is (maximum possible being "GRAITE")
         "---I-E", which breaks down, property by property, as follows.
