Thus, they are currently in the process of implementing a records system which has been designed to store, protect, and preserve digital records. The types of digital records include medical records, annual reports, birth records, etc. This records system requires a Digital Records Transfer tool which must provide government agencies of Hawaii with the ability to transfer digital records to the Hawaii State Archives. Its transfer process must use secure and authenticated methods that document and ensure that the entirety of the files have been transferred uncorrupted. Kukini is a digital records transfer tool that has been designed, implemented, tested, and evaluated for use within an archival framework.\r\n\r\n# Useful Links\r\n[User Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/Kukini/wiki/User-Guide)\r\n\r\n[Developer Guide](https://github.com/khiraide/Kukini/wiki/Developer-Guide)\r\n\r\n[Contact Us](https://github.com/khiraide/Kukini/wiki/Contact-Us)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
